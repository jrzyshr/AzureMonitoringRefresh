# Challenge 01: Alerts, Activity Logs and Service Health

[Previous Challenge](./01-Getting-Started.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge>](./03-Monitoring-Basics-And-Dashboards.md)

## Introduction

Activity Logs show everything that is happening to your resources at the API level. The Activity log is a platform log in Azure that provides insights into subscription-level events. This includes information such as when a resource is modified or when a virtual machine is started.

## Description

Understand Activity Logs, configure an Alert to get notified if a VM has been turned off, and view the service health.

- Update the parameters file and deployment script for the GenerateAlertRules.json template located in the AlertTemplates folder
    - Add the names of your VMs and ResouceId for your Action Group
- Deploy the GenerateAlertRules.json template using the sample PowerShell script (deployAlertRulesTemplate.ps1) or create a Bash script (look at the example from the initial deployment)
- Verify you have new Monitor Alert Rules in the Portal or from the command line (sample command is in the PowerShell deployment script using new Az Monitor cmdlets)
- Modify the GenerateAlertsRules.json to include “Disk Write Operations/Sec” and set a threshold of 20
- Rerun your template and verify your new Alert Rules are created for each of your VMs
- Create a new Action Rule that suppress alerts from the scale set and virtual machines

Bonus question/task:
- Will the Alert get fired if the VM was turned off from the OS? Or if the VM was not available? Why?

## Success Criteria
Show the Alert which got fired and explain what you have done.
